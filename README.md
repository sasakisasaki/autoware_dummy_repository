# Autoware Dummy Repository

This repository serves as a testing environment for Autoware-related CI/CD workflows. It contains minimal configuration to:

- Test GitHub Actions workflows
- Verify integration pipelines
- Simulate build processes without using the full Autoware stack
- Provide a lightweight sandbox for workflow development and testing

## Usage

This repository can be used to validate workflows before implementing them in production Autoware repositories. It mimics the basic structure needed for testing without the complexity of the full codebase.

## Note

This is not an actual implementation of Autoware functionality and should not be used for development purposes beyond workflow testing.
